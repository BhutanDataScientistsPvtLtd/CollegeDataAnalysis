We are trying to build a data ecosystem of a college in Bhutan called Royal Thimphu College

We hope that the ideas that we try out will help developers to pick up and understand how to improve not only our project but also
the continuing open source projects

So far we have created an excel crawler that intelligently find a way to convert a certain range or table into a csv file
